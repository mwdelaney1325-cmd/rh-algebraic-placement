=====================================================================
[0] STANDING CONTEXT
=====================================================================

No origin is assumed.  
No terminal state is assumed.  
No global certification is assumed.

All objects below are considered only under **indefinite continuation**.  
No finite truncation is privileged.  
No partial domain is terminal.

=====================================================================
[1] ALGEBRAIC OBJECT
=====================================================================

Define the Riemann zeta function for Re(s) > 1 by

    ζ(s) := ∑_{n=1}^{∞} n^{-s}.

It admits a unique meromorphic continuation to ℂ with a simple pole at s = 1.

Define the completed zeta function

    ξ(s) := ½ s(s−1) π^{-s/2} Γ(s/2) ζ(s),

which satisfies the functional equation

    ξ(s) = ξ(1 − s).

No probabilistic, geometric, spectral, or physical interpretation is assumed.

=====================================================================
[2] CONTINUATION AS STRUCTURAL GIVEN
=====================================================================

Analytic continuation is taken as a standing structural given:

• no finite truncation is privileged,  
• no local convergence certifies global behavior,  
• no partial domain is final.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
CONTINUATION INVARIANCE CONSTRAINT
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Any admissible algebraic property must remain invariant under all
continuation-compatible transports and involutions.

Equivalently: any admissible property must survive every allowable
continuation path without becoming path-dependent.

All algebraic statements below are required to satisfy this constraint.

=====================================================================
[3] TRANSPORT SYMMETRY
=====================================================================

Define the involution

    τ : s ↦ 1 − s.

The functional equation implies invariance under τ.

No direction is privileged.  
No half of the band is privileged.  
No fixed reference point inside 0 < Re(s) < 1 is admissible as a carrier
of “true” alignment.

Thus any admissible algebraic property asserted of ξ(s) must be stable under τ.

=====================================================================
[4] ZEROS AS REGISTERED ALGEBRAIC EVENTS (NON-REGIONAL)
=====================================================================

Define a nontrivial zero as any s ∈ ℂ such that

    0 < Re(s) < 1   and   ξ(s) = 0.

Zeros are not assumed primitive.  
They are **registered algebraic events under continuation**.

Only continuation-stable (non-path-dependent) registration is admissible:
if the status of a would-be event depends on a chosen continuation path,
it is not admissible as a non-regional algebraic registration.

=====================================================================
[5] NON-REGIONAL REGISTRABILITY (THE FORCED ALIGNMENT QUESTION)
=====================================================================

Let Z denote the set of admissibly registered nontrivial zeros.

Forced question:

(Q) Can Z be registered non-regionally (path-independently) while respecting
    τ-invariance under indefinite continuation?

Assume, for forcing, that Z contains zeros with unequal real parts:

    ∃ s₁, s₂ ∈ Z  with  Re(s₁) ≠ Re(s₂).

Then under τ-invariance and indefinite continuation:

• continuation-compatible transports become distinguishable,  
• involutive symmetry no longer preserves alignment globally,  
• algebraic registration becomes path-dependent.

This is **regional collapse**:  
alignment would depend on the chosen continuation path.

This violates the continuation invariance constraint.

Therefore, non-regional registrability forces a single stable real-part locus.

=====================================================================
[6] UNIQUE STABLE REAL PART (FORCED)
=====================================================================

Let σ be a real number such that all admissibly registered zeros satisfy

    Re(s) = σ.

τ-invariance requires that if Re(s) = σ is admissible as an alignment locus,
then Re(τ(s)) = 1 − σ must be the same locus.

Hence:

    σ = 1 − σ  
    σ = 1/2.

This value is not obtained by estimation.  
It is forced by involutive symmetry under the continuation invariance constraint.

=====================================================================
[7] STRUCTURAL EXCLUSION OF OFF-LINE ZEROS (PROPAGATION)
=====================================================================

If a zero existed with Re(s) ≠ 1/2, then:

• alignment would privilege a continuation path,  
• τ-symmetry would fail to preserve alignment non-regionally,  
• algebraic registration would collapse into a regional structure.

No local algebraic modification prevents this propagation,
because the violation is at the level of continuation-compatible invariance.

Thus any off-line zero is structurally incompatible with non-regional
algebraic registration under indefinite continuation.

=====================================================================
[8] TOTALITY (PLACED, NOT CERTIFIED)
=====================================================================

The statement

    ∀ s ∈ Z,  Re(s) = 1/2

is a totality statement.

Here it is **admissible as placement** because:

• continuation is already assumed,  
• no finite check is claimed,  
• no internal certification is introduced,  
• no origin or endpoint is asserted,  
• no readout construction is provided.

This is not totality as omniscience.  
It is totality at the correct algebraic placement: a constraint on admissible
non-regional registration under continuation.

=====================================================================
[9] RELATION TO OTHER OBSTRUCTIONS (NON-REDUNDANCY)
=====================================================================

This placement is not:

• diagonal self-reference (Gödel / Turing),  
• predicate inconsistency (Russell),  
• iterative non-termination (Zeno).

It concerns:

    invariance of algebraic alignment under indefinite continuation
    with involutive transport symmetry.

No syntax, semantics, or computation model is required.

=====================================================================
[10] STATEMENT (PLACEMENT ONLY)
=====================================================================

The Riemann Hypothesis expresses the unique non-regional algebraic alignment
compatible with:

• indefinite analytic continuation,  
• τ-invariance (s ↦ 1 − s),  
• continuation invariance,  
• non-regional registrability of zeros.

RH is not placed here as a zero-location fact.  
It is placed as an **alignment constraint**.

=====================================================================
STOP CONDITION
=====================================================================

No proof is constructed.  
No zero is computed.  
No readout is written.

Only the structural necessity of the critical line Re(s)=1/2
is placed as the unique non-regional alignment locus under continuation.
